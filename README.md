# Advent of Code - Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the **Advent of Code**
challenges, an annual programming event that takes place every December.
Each day, a new problem is released, gradually increasing in complexity
and requiring creative algorithmic approaches to solve.

## Repository Structure

-   Each folder corresponds to a specific **day** and **challenge**.
-   Solutions are implemented in **Python**, focusing on clean,
    efficient, and modular code.
-   Includes problems involving **data parsing, graph traversal,
    recursion, dynamic programming, simulations, and optimization
    techniques**.

## About Advent of Code

The **Advent of Code** is an annual programming competition created by
**Eric Wastl**. It consists of **25 days** of algorithmic challenges
designed to improve problem-solving skills, computational thinking, and
programming proficiency.
